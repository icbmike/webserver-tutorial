This is a C# dotnet repo for teaching how you might build a http server from a Hello World console app all the way to a framework resembling aspnetcore.

The intended usage is to checkout each commit and gradually progress from a Hello World console app to a partially featured http server.

Over the series of commits the following topics can be explored:

- HTTP as a protocol
  - What makes up a HTTP request/response
  - How a request in a text based protocol results in C# code being executed.
- Web apps vs Web Servers
- Dependency Injection
- Routing
  - Convention based routing vs attribute based routing
  - Other routing
- Middleware
  - Authentication/Authorization
